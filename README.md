# AM Transmitter and Receiver 🎙️📻

## DSP Lab is Really Fun! 🎧

In this project, we used **GNU Radio** to design an **AM transmitter and receiver** system.  

- The **source signal** is captured from your **PC's microphone**  
- The **receiver** plays the signal back through your **PC's speakers**  

Feel free to try it out and share your own version! 🚀
