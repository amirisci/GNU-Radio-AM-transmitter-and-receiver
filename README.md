# AM Transmitter and Receiver 🎙️📻

## DSP Lab is Really Fun! 🎧

In this project, we used **GNU Radio** to design an **AM transmitter and receiver** system.  

- The **source signal** is captured from your **PC's microphone**  
- The **receiver** plays the signal back through your **PC's speakers**  

So, if you’d like to **play spy with a friend**, just share the receiver code with them! 🕵️‍♂️  
Make sure you're both connected to the same network or have port access configured.

### 📡 How to Share:
1. On the sender side, open Command Prompt and run:
   ```bash
   ipconfig
